# ![exportFreeactionn](./docs/logo.svg)
A `.JSFL` script the speeds up making freeaction themes, by automatically clearing graphics, removing unused symbols, and setting up linkages.

## Setup
Add both files to your Scripts folder. Also make sure the `anifire` folder is included in the same place where your `.fla` is building from.

## Usage
1. Before using, make sure your libraries are organized into folders with their respective types (e.g.: `UPPER`,`LOWER`,`HAIR`,`FEET`,`HANDS`,`BEHIND BODY`).
2. Run the script while having your freeaction fla open. If you have any other symbols that need to be cleared that don't have linkage, type in the box provided.
3. Export the swf.
